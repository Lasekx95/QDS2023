## What is the Purpose of this Webapp?
In order to lessen the carbon footprint of Teck, a mining business in North America, our webapp tracks and records information about material transportation. This covers specifics like mileage, distance, car type, and weather. Employees in finance, operations, and administration can use the data after it has been gathered and shown in a dashboard. The webapp's tech stack consists of React with Nextjs 13, Tailwindcss, Django, and a number of APIs.
